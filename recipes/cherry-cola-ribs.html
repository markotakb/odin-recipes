    <img src="cherry-cola-ribs.jpg">

        <p></p><em>I've come to find out that cherry cola makes an incredibly delicious rack of ribs,</em></p>
        <p><em>which strangely enough, don't really taste like either cherry or cola,</em>
        
        <em>but taste very similar to your All-American Midwest-style barbecue.</em>

        <h2><strong>STEPS</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dry rub</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Whisk salt, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Wet rub</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Whisk mustard, vinegar, and 2 tablespoons cherry cola together in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Process</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil long enough to extend past the rack of ribs by at least 6 inches on both ends.</li>
                    <li>Use large size, heavy-duty foil if possible. Place the ribs, meat side up, on the foil.</li>
                    <li>Brush wet rub over top and sides, and sprinkle about 60% of dry rub over the surface</li>
                    <li>Turn ribs over and, with the bone side up, brush with wet rub, then sprinkle with all the remaining dry rub.</li>
                    <li>Center the ribs lengthwise on the foil, and bring up the ends of the foil, like a boat, and crimp so any juices will stay inside.</li>
                    <li>Crimp the two long edges together over the top of the ribs.</li>
                    <li>The foil doesnt have to be airtight, but the whole rack should be covered.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours.<strong>Remove, open the foil, and pour off juices that have accumulated in the foil into a saucepan.</li>
                    <li>Turn the rack meat side up, and brush with wet rub. Enclose again in the foil, and continue to roast at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Add any remaining wet rub to the juices in the saucepan, then add the 1 1/2 cups cherry cola, ketchup, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Bring to a simmer on medium high, cook until liquid is reduced by half.</li>
                    <li> Once it is the thickness of barbecue sauce, remove from heat entirely.</li>
                    <li>After one hour at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), remove ribs from the oven, and open out the foil, pressing foil flat to line the pan.</li>
                    <li>Turn the oven temperature up to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Brush ribs with sauce. Return ribs to the oven for 15 minutes. Repeat this process 4 times</li>
                    <li>Let ribs rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce!!!</strong></li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
